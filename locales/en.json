      "The Group Stage (GS) qualification probability is calculated based on the results of 1 million simulations. While there is a possibility of elimination with 6 points, it is treated as 100.0% because the probability is less than 0.01%.",
      "The default values for Win/Draw/Loss are calculated based on match results and FIFA rankings at the time from the past five Group Stages. Rankings are rounded up to the nearest ten (e.g., 1–10 to 10), and rankings of 50 or lower are treated as 50 for aggregation. Win and Loss probabilities are rounded down to integers, with the Draw probability adjusted to balance the total. Please use this for reference only.",
